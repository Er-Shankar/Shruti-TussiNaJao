                "Dear Shruti,<br>
                I can hardly believe I’m writing this. It feels like a dream, almost impossible, that I won’t see your familiar smile across office every day. I’ll miss you so, so much. You are such a great person  so pure, so warm, that it lit up every corner, every single day. Talking to you, chatting about guys, laughing, sometimes crying 🙈was always a highlight of all the house parties, with drinks in our hand and tears in our eyes ,  making everyone around us felt that twinge of jealousy at the bond we share.

You’re the heartbeat of every gathering, the one who keeps everyone together, be thy organising a birthday party or going to a temple or a movie or a farewell party and here we are planning one for you 🥹. I’ve never met anyone quite like you, someone so effortlessly goofy yet so deeply mature. You see the best in everyone and very kind.

I can’t imagine  leaving the office at 10 not seeing you there to say why are you still here leave go home. It is sad that there would be no tripling to drop you home and say bye . Knowing you won’t be there leaves an emptiness I can’t quite put into words. Maybe, in some parallel universe, we’re still gonna be  roommates, sharing life, laughter, and endless talks.

Until then, I’ll hold onto every memory and every moment. You’re irreplaceable, Shruti, and I’ll miss you more than you know. April it is and I am gonna meet you at Ranchi. Tab Tak k liye be happy don’t miss us, everyone is just one call away. Love you so much ♥️
With all my heart,
Diksha"
